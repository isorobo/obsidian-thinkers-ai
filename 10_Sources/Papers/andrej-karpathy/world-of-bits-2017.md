# World of Bits: An Open-Domain Platform for Web-Based Agents

## Citation

Shi, Tianlin, Andrej Karpathy, Linxi Fan, Jonathan Hernandez, and Percy Liang. "World of Bits: An Open-Domain Platform for Web-Based Agents". International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017, pp. 3135-3144. https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a.html.

## One-line summary

World of Bits defines an open-domain benchmark in which agents complete real web tasks via keyboard and mouse actions, with HTTP caching making live-internet tasks reproducible for training and evaluation.

## Key claims

- Standard RL environments lack the diversity and realism of human-created web artefacts; browser-based tasks fill this gap.
- Crowdworkers define tasks and demonstrate solutions on live websites; cached HTTP traffic then enables offline simulation and reproducible evaluation.
- Agents trained via behavioural cloning and reinforcement learning complete a range of web tasks including form-filling and booking flows.
- The platform exposes the difficulty of open-domain agent grounding: the action space (keyboard, mouse) is low-level but the observation space (rendered HTML) is high-dimensional.
- Reproducible web-agent benchmarks are a prerequisite for systematic progress on general-purpose agents.

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- This paper, published in 2017, predates the current agent boom by nearly a decade - it places Karpathy among the earliest researchers to frame web interaction as a tractable RL environment.
- The emphasis on reproducibility through HTTP caching reflects his engineering-first instinct: build infrastructure that makes systematic experimentation possible before chasing capability.
- The low-level action space (keyboard and mouse rather than API calls) anticipates the agentic-web infrastructure concerns he articulates in 2025 talks.
