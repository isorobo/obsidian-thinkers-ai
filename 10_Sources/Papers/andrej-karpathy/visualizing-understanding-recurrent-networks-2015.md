# Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej, Justin Johnson, and Li Fei-Fei. "Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks". arXiv:1506.02078, 2015. https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02078.

## One-line summary

Character-level LSTM probing reveals interpretable cells that track long-range dependencies, explaining where the architecture outperforms n-gram baselines.

## Key claims

- LSTM networks excel on character-level language modelling tasks but lack rigorous interpretability frameworks.
- Probing individual hidden units identifies cells that track structural patterns such as line length, open quotes, and bracket depth across many time steps.
- Performance gains over n-gram models arise specifically from the network's ability to capture long-range structural dependencies.
- Comparison with n-gram baselines isolates the contribution of recurrent memory to predictive accuracy.
- Error analysis pinpoints failure modes and suggests concrete directions for further improvement.

## Excerpts

> "We find that the LSTM has discovered, at the level of individual hidden units, interpretable cells that keep track of long-range dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets."
> ~ Abstract

> "We identify the specific properties and failure modes of LSTMs and discuss the settings in which they are advantageous compared to simpler n-gram models."
> ~ Abstract

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- Karpathy's persistent interest in looking inside trained models - rather than treating them as black boxes - predates the modern interpretability research agenda by several years.
- The paper applies empirical, diagnostic methods to neural networks rather than theoretical analysis, reflecting his engineering-oriented epistemology.
- The identification of specific cells that perform human-legible tracking anticipates Karpathy's later "LLM OS" framing, in which he treats learned representations as real computational structures worthy of study.
