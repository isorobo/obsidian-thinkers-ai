# Conditional Retrieval and Implicit Curricula in Transformers (2024)

## Citation

Tiberiu Musat (2024). *Conditional Retrieval and Implicit Curricula in Transformers*. ICLR 2025. https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12118

## One-line summary

Identifies a logarithmic-depth lower bound for transformer-based retrieval and shows that successful learning of the task depends on an implicit curriculum that orders attention-head emergence.

## Key claims

- Solving the retrieval problem with transformers requires a number of layers that grows logarithmically with input size.
- Large language models solve the task zero-shot under varied prompt formulations.
- Successful training on a minimal formulation depends on an implicit curriculum embedded in the data distribution.
- Attention heads emerge in a specific order during training, dictated by the curriculum, and their roles are mechanistically interpretable.

## Excerpts

> In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple yet common reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers, which grows logarithmically with the input size. I empirically show that large lan- guage models can solve the task under different prompting formulations without any fine-tuning. To understand how transformers solve the retrieval problem, I train several transformers on a minimal formulation. Successful learning occurs only under the presence of an implicit curriculum. I uncover the learned mech- anisms by studying the attention maps in the trained transformers. I also study the training process, uncovering that attention heads always emerge in a specific sequence guided by the implicit curriculum. Alice lives in Wonderland. [...] Harry's mother is Alice. [...] Wizards live with their mothers. [...] Harry is a wizard. [...] Where does Harry live? Harry lives in Wonderland. Large Language Model Conditional Retrieval Question [...] = irrelevant information to ensure full reasoning e.g. Mary is a pirate. Aslan lives in Narnia. etc. A = 7 [...] B = A [...] C = B [...] D = C [...] What is the value of D? The value of D is 7. Large Language Model Retrieval Question [...] = irrelevant information to ensure full retrieval, e.g. H = 2, G = H, etc. Figure 1: Illustrative examples of retrieval and conditional retrieval questions.
