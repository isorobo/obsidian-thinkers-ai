# Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback (2022)

## Citation

Yuntao Bai et al. (2022). *Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback*. arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073

## One-line summary

Introduces Constitutional AI and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); trains a harmless but non-evasive assistant using only a written constitution and AI-generated critiques, eliminating human harmlessness labels.

## Key claims

- Self-critique and revision against a written constitution produce harmlessness training data without human labels.
- The RLAIF stage replaces human harmlessness comparisons with model-generated preferences, scaling oversight further.
- {'The resulting assistant is non-evasive': 'it explains objections rather than refusing silently.'}
- Chain-of-thought reasoning improves both human-judged performance and behavioural transparency.

## Excerpts

> As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self- improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as ‘Constitutional AI’. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then ﬁnetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the ﬁnetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI prefer- ences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use ‘RL from AI Feedback’ (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non- evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels. ∗Correspondence to: {yuntao,jared}@anthropic.com Author contributions are detailed in 7. arXiv:2212.08073v1 [cs.CL] 15 Dec 2022 === PAGE BREAK === Generate Responses to “Red Teaming” Prompts Eliciting Harmful Samples Generate Responses to “Red Teaming” Prompts Eliciting Harmful Samples RLAIF Training with PM + SL-CAI Models Constitutional AI Feedback for Self-Improvement Helpful RLHF Model Generate Responses to “Red Teaming” Prompts Eliciting Harmful Samples Generate Responses to “Re
