# Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin (2015)

## Citation

Dario Amodei et al. (2015). *Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin*. arXiv (ICML 2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595

## One-line summary

First-author flagship from Amodei's Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab era; demonstrates end-to-end deep learning speech recognition reaching parity with human transcribers on English and Mandarin via aggressive HPC techniques.

## Key claims

- End-to-end deep learning replaces hand-engineered speech pipelines with a single neural network trained per language.
- HPC techniques (custom kernels, all-reduce gradient sync, mixed-precision arithmetic) yield a 7x speedup, turning multi-week experiments into multi-day iterations.
- The trained system matches or surpasses human transcription on standard English and Mandarin benchmarks.
- Batch Dispatch enables low-latency online deployment on GPU servers, demonstrating production viability.

## Excerpts

> We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech—two vastly different languages. Be- cause it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural net- works, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech includ- ing noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system [26]. Because of this efﬁciency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior ar- chitectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, deliver- ing low latency when serving users at scale.
