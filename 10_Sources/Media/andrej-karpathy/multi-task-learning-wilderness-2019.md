# Multi-Task Learning in the Wilderness

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej. "Multi-Task Learning in the Wilderness". ICML 2019 Autonomous Driving Workshop, Long Beach, June 2019. https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness.

## One-line summary

Karpathy describes Tesla Autopilot as a production-scale multi-task learning system that must simultaneously identify dozens of object categories from eight cameras alone, treating safety as requiring 99.999% accuracy.

## Key claims

- Tesla Autopilot relies on eight cameras providing 360-degree coverage with no LIDAR and no HD maps; the neural network must infer depth, velocity, and acceleration from vision alone.
- The system simultaneously identifies static objects, moving vehicles, pedestrians, animals, road signs, traffic signals, lane markings, curbs, and crosswalks across diverse environments.
- Safety requires 99.999% accuracy; the system iterates through a data engine loop of building datasets, training networks, deploying them, and incorporating observed errors.
- "Designing adaptive models and algorithms that can efficiently learn, master, and combine multiple tasks is the next frontier."
- Tesla's fleet of approximately one million vehicles provides a data advantage no competitor can match.
- Human data refinement remains essential to ensure the network builds accurate representations of real driving conditions.

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- The "data engine" concept - iterative deployment followed by error mining and retraining - emerges here as a production engineering philosophy; it later reappears in Karpathy's Software 3.0 agent loop framing.
- Karpathy treats fleet scale as a strategic moat: access to real-world data at volume substitutes for simulator fidelity and sensor redundancy.
- His rejection of LIDAR and HD maps represents an engineering bet on sufficiency of vision, consistent with his later framing that cameras are superior sensing modalities for human-navigated environments.
