# State of GPT

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej. "State of GPT". Microsoft Build 2023, May 2023. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6zNXZaIiiI.

## One-line summary

A technical walkthrough of the full GPT assistant training pipeline - from pretraining through RLHF - paired with practical prompting guidance for practitioners.

## Key claims

- GPT assistant development proceeds through four sequential stages: tokenization, pretraining, supervised finetuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
- Pretraining produces a powerful but unaligned base model; supervised finetuning and RLHF constrain and orient its outputs toward human preferences.
- Prompting strategies, chain-of-thought reasoning, and tool use represent the near-term frontier for practitioners deploying these models.
- The ecosystem of tools built around GPT is growing fast and will extend the models' effective capabilities substantially.
- Mental models for how LLMs generate text - token-by-token probability distributions - are essential for using them well.

## Excerpts

> "Dive deeper into practical techniques and mental models for the effective use of these models, including prompting strategies, finetuning, the rapidly growing ecosystem of tools, and their future extensions."
> ~ Talk abstract

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- Karpathy treats the GPT training pipeline as an engineering system with clearly separable stages - consistent with his preference for decomposing complex processes into inspectable components.
- His emphasis on mental models for practitioners reflects the educational mission that would crystallise in Eureka Labs.
- The talk sits between technical depth and practical accessibility, the register Karpathy has made his signature.
