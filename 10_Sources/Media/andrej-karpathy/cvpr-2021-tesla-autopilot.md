# Tesla Autopilot at CVPR 2021

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej. "Tesla Autopilot at CVPR 2021". CVPR 2021 Workshop on Autonomous Driving, virtual, 20 June 2021. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6bOwQdCJrc.

## One-line summary

Karpathy announces Tesla's full transition to vision-only perception, arguing that cameras can match or exceed radar and LIDAR for depth and velocity estimation while the fleet's six billion labelled objects enable auto-labelling at scale.

## Key claims

- Tesla removed radar sensors and now relies solely on eight cameras; the new vision-only system achieves higher precision and recall than the previous sensor fusion approach.
- "If our [human] neural network can determine depth and velocity, can synthetic neural nets do it too? Internally, our answer is an unequivocal yes."
- Tesla's fleet generates training data via 221 manually implemented triggers; the first release dataset contains six billion labelled objects across one million 10-second videos at 1.5 petabytes.
- Auto-labelling uses larger offline models to label data, followed by human cleanup; this approach is "very powerful."
- "No fleet, no go" remains Tesla's stance - scale of real-world data is the irreplaceable ingredient.
- Auto-labelling and human refinement together close the gap between curated benchmarks and real-world driving conditions.

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- Karpathy's vision-only commitment is now stated as settled fact rather than a bet; the performance data at CVPR 2021 frames it as an engineering conclusion, not a hypothesis.
- The six-billion-object dataset illustrates his consistent view that scale of real-world data beats simulator fidelity or sensor redundancy.
- His auto-labelling pipeline (large model plus human cleanup) anticipates the synthetic data and midtraining work he later led at OpenAI.
