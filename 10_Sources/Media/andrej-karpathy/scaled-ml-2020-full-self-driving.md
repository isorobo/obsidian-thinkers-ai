# AI for Full Self-Driving at Tesla

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej. "AI for Full Self-Driving at Tesla". ScaledML 2020, Computer History Museum, 20 April 2020. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8.

## One-line summary

Karpathy explains Tesla's vision-only approach to full self-driving, arguing that eight cameras and a million-vehicle fleet make LIDAR and HD maps unnecessary.

## Key claims

- Tesla's approach differs fundamentally from competitors: vision-only with eight cameras, no LIDAR, no HD maps - the neural network infers everything from video.
- "I think the critical point to make is that it looks the same, but under the hood, it is completely different, in terms of the approach we take towards full self-driving."
- One million active Tesla vehicles globally provide continuous training data, enabling iterative refinement through the data engine loop.
- The system addresses the long tail of exception cases; the AI team works through rare edge cases to approach complete driving safety.
- Tesla pursues pseudo-LIDAR via vision-only neural networks learning accurate depth predictions.
- Human engineers perform data refinement to ensure accurate representation of real driving conditions.

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- Karpathy treats fleet data at scale as the decisive competitive variable; this is consistent with his later claim that model capabilities depend on "data coverage" in his verifiability equation.
- His commitment to vision-only over sensor fusion reflects a pattern of seeking simpler, more general solutions over sensor-specific engineering.
- The data engine loop (deploy, mine errors, retrain) appears here as a practitioner's production methodology, not a theoretical construct.
