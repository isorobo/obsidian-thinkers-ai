# Vibe Coding MenuGen

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej. "Vibe Coding MenuGen". karpathy.bearblog.dev, 27 April 2025. https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/vibe-coding-menugen/.

## One-line summary

Karpathy documents building a restaurant menu-to-dish-image app through vibe coding, finding the prototype trivially fast to build but deployment painful due to fragmented APIs, rate limits, and configuration overhead.

## Key claims

- MenuGen photographs restaurant menus and generates images of each dish using OpenAI vision APIs and Replicate image generation.
- Building a local prototype took minimal time; shipping it as a real product exposed a long tail of configuration pain - environment variables, domain ownership, Stripe account setup.
- "Claude kept hallucinating deprecated APIs, model names, and input/output conventions," demonstrating that LLMs remain unreliable co-pilots for rapidly evolving API surfaces.
- Modern app development resembles "assembling IKEA furniture" - many disconnected services each requiring extensive individual configuration.
- Solutions include pre-configured platforms, more LLM-friendly APIs with stable conventions, or simpler stacks such as Python and FastAPI.
- The demo-to-product gap is a central theme: what works in a prototype fails at the rate-limiting and authentication seams of production deployment.

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- The menugen app reappears in Karpathy's Sequoia AI Ascent 2026 talk as the paradigm case for Software 3.0, where "much of the app disappears" - but here he focuses on what does not disappear and why it causes friction.
- His candour about LLM failures (hallucinated APIs) is consistent with his "jagged intelligence" framing: he neither dismisses nor overclaims.
- His practical observation that deployment infrastructure lags behind LLM capability points to a systems engineering gap he repeatedly identifies: agents need stable, machine-readable interfaces to function reliably.
