# microgpt

## Citation

Karpathy, Andrej. "microgpt". karpathy.github.io, 12 February 2026. http://karpathy.github.io/2026/02/12/microgpt/.

## One-line summary

Karpathy presents a 200-line, dependency-free Python implementation of a full GPT as the logical endpoint of a decade-long project to strip language model training to its irreducible essentials.

## Key claims

- A complete GPT training and inference loop requires only 200 lines of pure Python with no external dependencies.
- The file contains the full algorithmic content: dataset, tokeniser, autograd engine, transformer architecture, Adam optimiser, training loop, and inference loop.
- Everything beyond those 200 lines is efficiency, not algorithm: the claim is that microgpt captures GPT-2's essential mathematics.
- The autograd engine operates on scalars, making gradient flow observable in a way that tensor-level libraries obscure.
- The attention mechanism is described as "a token communication mechanism" while the MLP layers handle computation.
- microgpt is described as the culmination of earlier projects - micrograd, makemore, nanoGPT, llm.c - each of which stripped one further layer of abstraction.
- Modern ChatGPT-scale models run the same algorithm, scaled enormously and post-trained; the fundamental next-token prediction mechanism remains unchanged.

## Reveals about tendency of thought

- The microgpt project is the purest expression of Karpathy's pedagogical programme: reduce a system to its irreducible core and verify it still works, then teach from that core outward.
- Framing the project as an "art project" signals that simplicity itself has aesthetic and epistemic value, not merely didactic value.
- The lineage from micrograd to microgpt shows a deliberate, multi-year strategy of building a complete self-contained curriculum, consistent with the Eureka Labs mission.
